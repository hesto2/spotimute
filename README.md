# Spotimute
Automatically mutes your spotify when an ad comes on, and then unmutes it when it is over. Checks every 3 seconds using spotify's applescript interface.
## Compatibility
Only works on OSX since it leverages applescript. If you find a way to do a similar thing on windows, please let me know!
## Installation
`brew install shpotify`

`npm install spotimute`

## Running
To run it, simply use the command `spotimute`. If you want it to run in the background, just add a `&` to the end of the command.
